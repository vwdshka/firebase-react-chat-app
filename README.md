Dave's Chat Room 💬

🔭 What can the app do?

👨‍💻 By using some of the greatest and most important concepts of React, which are React Hooks and React States combined with Firebase I have made a basic chat room for concurrent users. The chat app is user friendly as it has a bad-word filter which automatically bans the account that has connected to the server.

🔐 The authentication method used in this specific project is by Google Auth which is directly sent to the Firebase DB and later on adds a session for the user that has logged-in.

🌐 App Showcase

🛸 First, we land on the starter page where it requires us to log in by using our Google Account. We are also met by a kind warning to not violate community guidelines (in other words, use non-family-friendly words)

🖥️ After we have completed our Google Authentication process, we are met by all the people that are present in the chat room. We can exchange messages with them on real-time as shown in the example.
